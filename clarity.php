					<p>At Scandi Labs we believe there is no substitute for iterative prototyping to clarify a project's needs and scope and fulfill the client's hopes and expectations for their product.</p>
					
					<p>Typical Scandi Labs' projects begin with a three-week discovery and RAMP (rapid application mapping and prototyping) period, focusing on the product's key functionality, components, and structure.</p> 
					
					<p>This results a clear product development plan, budget, and schedule, avoiding the endemic wasted effort or missteps of other development methods that often lead to product restructuring, high development burn rates, and constantly moving launch dates.</p>
					
					<p>Scandi Labs' clients can have absolute confidence that after the RAMP process they will be prepared and ready to build the product they envisioned and need.</p>
