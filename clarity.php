					<p>At Scandi Labs we believe there is no substitute for iterative prototyping to clarify a project’s needs and scope.</p>
					
					<p>Typical Scandi Labs’ projects begin with a three-week discovery and RAMP (rapid application mapping and prototyping) period, focusing on the product’s key functionality, components, and structure.</p> 
					
					<p>This results a clear product development plan, budget, and schedule, avoiding product restructuring, high development burn rates, and constantly moving launch dates.</p>
					
					<p>Scandi labs’ clients can have absolute confidence that after the RAMP process they will be prepared and ready to build the product they envisioned and need.</p>
