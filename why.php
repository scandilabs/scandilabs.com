	        		<h1>Why We are Different</h1>
	        		<h2>Startup speed, enterprise scaling</h2>
	        		<p>We grew up doing enterprise software in the 90s, but we have spent most of the last decade building consumer web and business to business online properties.  And along the way, we have figured out how to combine the best of both worlds.  This knowledge and experience is embedded in the open source Catamaran Framework, where we continue to evolve it in collaboration with the open source community.  <a href="speed-vs-scale">MORE..</a></p>
	        		<h2>Our secret sauce -- made public</h2>
	        		<p>All consulting companies build up knowledge and experience over time.  This is why people hire consultants.</p>
	        		<p>However, we share this knowledget and experience with our clients and the broader developer community through Catamaran Framework -- our open source development framework.</p>
	        		<p>This benefits our clients directly in the following ways:</p>
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>We spend our time (and our clients' money) solving client-specific problems, as opposed to general technical problems.</li>
	        			<li>On-board technical resources quickly.</li>
	        			<li>Easily transfer knowledge and code ownership over to our clients.</li>
	        			<li>Collaborate on development with our clients without having to be co-located.</li>
	        			<li>Retain learning via Catamaran FAQ, our knowledge management tool, and continuous updates to the framework.</li>
	        			<li>Share our knowledge and experience with the wider world, and receive feedback and new ideas from community members in return.</li>
