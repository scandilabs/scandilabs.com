					<h1>About Scandi Labs</h1>
		        	<p>Scandi Labs was founded in 2012 because we saw a hole in the marketplace for software development services.</p>  
		        	    
		        	<p>At the "get something up and running quickly" end of you had young and smart web developers powered by popular frameworks like Ruby on Rails.  And at the "mission critical business systems" end you had big and slow systems integrators who could scale performance and team sizes.  But if you needed both speed and scale, you were generally out of luck.</p>
		        	<p>We are working to change that.  We have proven there is a need for a service provider who can combine enterprise experience with startup speed and value.</p>

	        		<h1>Real world startup scaling examples</h1>
	        		<p>One of the things that I've found throughout my career is the need to have long-lived processes. And Ruby, like many scripting languages, has trouble being an environment for long lived processes. But the JVM is very good at that, because it's been optimized for that over the last ten years.<br/><em>- <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">Steve Jenson, Twitter</a></em></p>
					<p>PHP's popularity and simplicity made it easy for the company's developers to quickly build new features. But PHP's (lack of) performance makes scaling Facebook's site to handle hundreds of billions of page views a month problematic, so Facebook has made big investments in making it leaner and faster.<br/><em>- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/facebook-looks-to-fix-php-performance-with-hiphop-virtual-machine/">Sean Gallagher, ars technica</a></em></p>
