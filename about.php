					<h1>About Scandi Labs</h1>
		        	<p>Scandi Labs was founded in 2012 because we saw a hole in the marketplace.  At the "get something up and running" of the market you have young and smart web developers powered by popular frameworks like Ruby on Rails.  At the "missing critical business systems" end you have established enterprise service providers using tools and technologies that easily scale to multiple developers, high-traffic, and complex integrations with other systems.  But if you want to work with firms who know both speed and scale, you're generally out of luck.</p>
		        	<p>But no longer.  We are proving that there is a need for people who want to combine enterprise experience and knowledge with startup speed and value.</p>

	        		<h1>Real world startup scaling examples</h1>
	        		<p>One of the things that I've found throughout my career is the need to have long-lived processes. And Ruby, like many scripting languages, has trouble being an environment for long lived processes. But the JVM is very good at that, because it's been optimized for that over the last ten years.<br/><em>- <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">Steve Jenson, Twitter</a></em></p>
					<p>PHP's popularity and simplicity made it easy for the company's developers to quickly build new features. But PHP's (lack of) performance makes scaling Facebook's site to handle hundreds of billions of page views a month problematic, so Facebook has made big investments in making it leaner and faster.<br/><em>- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/facebook-looks-to-fix-php-performance-with-hiphop-virtual-machine/">Sean Gallagher, ars technica</a></em></p>
