        		<h1>User Experience Oversight</h1>
        		<p>We will work with clients who have their own product function, including user experience experts and graphical designers</p>
        		<p>For clients who don't have a product function, or who want to leverage Scandi Labs to create a shared consensus, we bring in our own user experience designers.  This involvement will vary a bit depending on whether it's a <a href="consumer-web">consumer web</a> or <a href="enterprise">b2b or enterprise</a> project.</p>

        		<h1>Agile Process</h1>
        		<p>As long-time students of software development processes, we have hands-on experience with everything from Scrum and Kanban to RUP and waterfall.</p>
        		<p>As a result, we are confident in our ability to strike the right balance between anarchy and bueraucracy.  Our typical process will include:</p>
        		<ul>
	        		<li>Weekly reviews of running code</li>
	        		<li>Tracking and joint prioritization of the next two week's worth of work</li>
	        		<li>Defect and issue tracking</li>

        		<h1>On Tap Resources</h1>
        		<p>Our clients' needs are subject to changes in funding, executive focus and budgets, and we understand that.  So we make it easy to add or remove resources on a week-by-week basis.</p>
        		<p>Once the number and type of resources has been established, we prefer a monthly billing relationship over a negotiated scope and fee.  We want to make sure we spend our time moving the ball forward, not stuck in negotiations.</p>
