	        		<h2>Domain Understanding</h2>
	        		<p>We believe that in order to be an effective partner we need to have a good grasp of our client's business.  From Healthcare IT to Education, Finance, Technology and Supply Chain Management, we have prior experience in many industries.  And we read up if we don't.</p>
	        		<h2>User Buy-In through Prototyping</h2>
	        		<p>The key to a successful B2B or Enterprise product launch is stakeholder buy-in.  Our experience goes back to the early nineties when companies like Cambridge Technology Partners and Sapient facilitated Rapid Application Development sessions to help various stake holders come together aroud a feature set.  This approach, coupled with frequent reviews with key users, ensure successful prototyping and product build-outs.</p>
	        		<h2>Quickly Up and Running</h2>
	        		<p>We get an MVP (minimally viable product) up and running quickly, in order to facilitate collaboration and feature convergence across users and stake holders.</p>
	        		<h2>API's and Integration</h2>
	        		<p>Our adherence to clean code, proper assigment of responsibilities to components, and a <a href="technology-stack">flexible development framework</a> we make it a breeze to create API's and integration points with other systems.</p>
