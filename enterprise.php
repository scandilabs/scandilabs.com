	        		<h2>Business Understanding</h2>
	        		<p>We believe that in order to be an effective partner we need to have a good grasp of our client's business.  From Healthcare IT to Finance, Technology, and Education, we have prior experience in many industries.  And we read up if we don't.</p>
	        		<h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
	        		<p>We get an MVP (minimally viable product) up and running quickly, in order to facilitate collaboration and buy-in from users and stakeholders.</p>
	        		<h2>API's and Integration</h2>
	        		<p>Our first-rate <a href="technology-stack">enterprise technology</a>, with adherence to clean code and proper assigment of responsibilities to components, makes it a breeze to create API's and integration points with other systems.</p>

                        "For far too long the enterprise software selection decision has been a primarily IT-led and feature-set-focused process, with feedback from actual users typically playing a much less significant role than that required. Ignoring user opinion, of which user experience (UX) is a big part, has not gone unpunished of course, and has resulted in familiar problems including expensive training and lack of adoption."
