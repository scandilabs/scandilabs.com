            	<h2 class="noTopMargin">Mads Kvalsvik, Founder and CEO</h2>
            	
				<p>Mads has a deep passion for entrepreneurship, and is always looking for the best way to help build startup ventures.  He started ScandiLabs for companies who needed to put together a well-integrated tech team and build a scalable product quickly.</p>  
				<p>Previously, Mads served as head of new technology ventures for Boathouse Group in Waltham, MA.  There he led the incubation of several online businesses including <a href="http://speedbilly.com" target="_new">speedbilly.com</a>, an auto marketplace and <a href="http://postpost.com" target="_new">postpost.com</a>, a social search engine.</p>
				<p>Earlier he co-founded Savant Technologies, an e-Commerce solutions provider. The business was later sold to IntraLinks, a leading provider of virtual datarooms.  While at IntraLinks Mads led the design and development of the company's flagship SaaS offering and introduced Agile to a 50-person strong team.</p>
				<p>His background also includes work with CNN, Toyota Motors, NPR, BBC Technology, Mohegan Sun, Teradyne, telegea.com, c-tribe.com, and even a one-year stint as an Assistant Professor of object oriented design.  When not helping startups he tries to keep up with his two young boys on the soccer field.</p> 
				<p>Mads grew up in Norway, and graduated from MIT in 1994.</p>
