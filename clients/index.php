                            Founder, Madaket Health

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>
                            Doctors need to enroll with insurance companies before they can start accepting patients.  The current process is slow and imposes a paper burden on medical office staff and hospitals.  And while insurance companies are processing dead-tree paperwork, doctors lose money.  Madaket Health was created to collect enrollment data once and then automate the interface with insurance companies.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They needed a technical team that combined enterprise IT experience with startup speed and flexibility.  
                        </p>
