                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>
                            Home buyers need to find a good inspector and schedule an appointment quickly before closing on a new house.  But how do they find a good inspector who is available on a short notice?  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A group of entrepreneurs with extensive real estate backgrounds built a service to connect home buyers and real estate agents with inspectors in their area.  This would make inspection scheduling easier and save everyone time.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The ScandiLabs Solution</h4>
                        <p>
                              ScandiLabs helped define the problem and build a robust solution using our rapid Java web framework.  Project highlights:
                        </p>
                        <ul>                                
        					<li>Defined the technology and created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li>
        					<li>Built and hosted the MVP on the ScandiLabs Java platform</li>
        					<li>Performed three major iterations of the MVP in response to customer feedback</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In the end, ScandiLabs delivered a solution that was quickly adopted by over 900 realtors at major real estate brokerages such as Coldwell Banker, Keller Williams, and ReMax.
