					    Startup Speed, Enterprise Scaling
					</h1>
					<h2>
					    Startups Are Fast					     
					</h2>
					<p>This is in part because they don't have any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance" target="_new">maintenance costs</a> yet:</p>
                    <img src="assets/dev_vs_maint_cost.png" />
                    <p>Also, recent <a href="catamaran">web development frameworks</a> like Rails, Django and Play make individual developers more productive.</p>

                    <h2>But Startups Don't Scale Well</h2>                    
                    <p>Over time, maintenance costs catch up.  And frameworks get slow and quick-start features become constraints that limit technical progress.</p>

                    <h2>The Scandi Labs Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        We match startup speed with pro-active steps to lower complexity and maintenance costs through:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Techology Specialization:</strong> A more flexible <a href="catamaran">development framework</a> that provides speed but doesn't cause problems down the road</li>
                            <li><strong>Knowledge Management:</strong> Continuous learning means we only have to solve technical problems once</li>
                            <li><strong>Enterprise Experience:</strong> Lightweight best-of-breed enterprise technology and people processes</li>
                        </ul>
                        Our approach limits maintenance costs which translates into better value for our clients:

                    <p><strong>Scaling the Tech Team:</strong> Existing resources are good coders but not managers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Site is Slow:</strong> The technology platform doesn't scale well and bottlenecks are difficult to change without breaking everything.</p>
                    <p><strong>Last 10% Problem:</strong> The framework made the first 90% of functionality easy, but implementing the last 10% is painfully slow and requires ugly hacks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Complex Infrastructure:</strong> Technology Executives keep buying expensive enterprise tools that are difficult to integrate with existing infrastructure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> It took a painful death march to get the existing infrastructure running, now engineers inflate change estimates so they don't have to rock the boat again.</p>
                    <p><strong>Poor Code Quality:</strong> Developers shoehorn new code into established patterns instead of doing things "the right way".</p>
