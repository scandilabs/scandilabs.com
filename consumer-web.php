	        		<h2>Early Prototyping</h2>
	        		<p>When creating consumer web online properties, we generally start with an existing design or we bring in our user experience experts to create an initial clickable prototype.</p>
                    <h2>Quickly Up and Running</h2>
                    <p>We aim to get a bare-bones MVP (minimally viable product) up and running as quickly as possible, so that we can facilitate a highly collaborative working style with our clients.</p>
	        		<h2>Graphical Design and Copy</h2>
	        		<p>The focus on rapid construction of the MVP also facilitates graphical design and copy writing.  We work with our client's design staff, or help source the right resources via our local network of freelancers.</p>
                    <h2>Facilitate Visitor Feedback</h2>
                    <p>With consumer sites, getting representative visitor feedback can be tricky.  Therefore, we ensure that the site is properly tagged for analytics from the very start, and we also structure the url paths in a way that lends itself to easy conversion rate tuning and A/B testing.</p>

	        		<h1>Mobile</h1>
	        		<p>Our mobile development capability spans both mobile web sites and native applications for the iOS and Android platforms.</p>
	        		<p>We focus on quick wins for our clients, and typically recommend exposing a subset of the browser-based features.</p>
	        	    <p>Our mobile applications generally leverage the same server-side services used by browser applications.</p>
