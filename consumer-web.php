	        		<h1>Consumer Web</h1>
	        		<h2>Early Prototyping</h2>
	        		<p>When creating consumer web online properties, we generally start with an existing design or we bring in our user experience experts to create an initial clickable prototype.</p>
	        		<h2>Quality Code from day one</h2>
	        		<p>We always use full-stack developers who own both the front-end web code (HTML/CSS/Javascript) and the back-end Java and REST service code.  That way, we ensure code quality and minimize design debt from the start.</p>
	        		<h2>Enable Feedback</h2>
	        		<p>With consumer sites, getting representative visitor feedback can be tricky.  Therefore, we ensure that the site is properly tagged for analytics from the very start, and we also structure the url paths in a way that lends itself to easy conversion rate tuning and A/B testing.</p>
	        		<h2>Quickly Up and Running</h2>
	        		<p>And most importantly, we aim to get a bare-bones MVP (minimally viable product) site up and running as quickly as possible, so that we can facilitate a highly collaborative working style with our clients.</p>
	        		<h2>Art and Copy</h2>
	        		<p>The focus on rapid construction of the MVP also facilitates art direction and copy writing.  We work with our client's design staff, or help source the right resources via our local network of freelancers.</p>

	        		<h1>Real world startup scaling</h1>
	        		<p>Over time we found that although Rails works great for doing front-end web development, for doing heavy weight back-end processing, Rails had some performance limitations at runtime.<br/><em>- <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">Alex Payne, Twitter</a></em></p>
	        		<p>One of the things that I've found throughout my career is the need to have long-lived processes. And Ruby, like many scripting languages, has trouble being an environment for long lived processes. But the JVM is very good at that, because it's been optimized for that over the last ten years.<br/><em>- <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">Steve Jenson, Twitter</a></em></p>
					<p>PHP's popularity and simplicity made it easy for the company's developers to quickly build new features. But PHP's (lack of) performance makes scaling Facebook's site to handle hundreds of billions of page views a month problematic, so Facebook has made big investments in making it leaner and faster.<br/><em>- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/facebook-looks-to-fix-php-performance-with-hiphop-virtual-machine/">Sean Gallagher, ars technica</a></em></p>
