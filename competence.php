			<h1>We believe competence boils down to three things:</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Ability to understand problems and relate them to previous experience</li>
				<li>An understanding of a broader <em>industry and technical context</em></li>
				<li>A pragmatic approach to solving problems and building solutions in a rapid, repeatable and scaleable way</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h1>Making software development simple for our clients requires that we have competence in a variety of areas, including:</h1>

			<p><strong>Programming Languages.</strong>  From C++, Objective-C and C# to Ruby, Python and Java, there are a lot to choose from.  We generally work with Java, and <a href="languages">here is why</a> and how it stacks up against the rest.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Development Frameworks.</strong>  These days, everybody makes use of some type of software development framework to avoid having to re-invent the wheel.  Frameworks lower learning and setup times, and offer substantial time and cost savings.  But they can also lead to difficulty with scaling and require ugly workarounds to solve "the last 10% problem".  At Scandi Labs we combine the most popular open source Java frameworks (EE 6, Spring, Hibernate) with further improvements managed through our own open source Catamaran Framework.  <a href="frameworks">Read on</a> to learn more about how we use Catamaran and how it compares to alternative approaches.</p>   
	        
	        <p><strong>Technology Stack.</strong>  To avoid spending a lot of time (and client money) on learning and managing a lot of different technology platforms, we try to standardize on certain technology platforms and technologies while retaining the flexibility to accommodate our clients' existing technology investments.  At present our preferred database is MySQL, our cloud/hosting provider is Amazon AWS and our preferred application server is Tomcat.  But we also make use of a number of <a href="stack">other technologies</a>.</p>

	        <p><strong>Process.</strong>  We take "process" to mean:  Making a bunch of people with different and/or similar skill sets work together effectively.  This highly depends on the people involved.  But that said, there's <a href="process">a lot to it</a> that can be very useful when properly excercised.</p>    
	        
	        <h3>Cloud</h3>
	        
	        <h3>Open Source</h3>
	        
	        <h3>Social Media</h3>
	        
	        <h3>Mobile Devices</h3>
	        
	        <h3>Usability</h3>
