            <h3>What is ScandiLabs Java?</h3>
            <p>Like most software developers, we at ScandiLabs are constantly striving to do a better job.  That means constant learning, knowledge retention, and process improvement.</p>
            <p>But unlike many for-profit companies, we actively promote sharing our knowledge.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
            
            <h3>Why share knowledge publicly?</h3>
            <p>We admit there is a potential down side to our talented software developers sharing things so generously.  For one thing, our competitors have full access to most of our institutional knowledge.  And some potential clients may decide they don't need to hire us since they can get our tools, HOWTO's, and Framework code for free.</p>
            <p>However we believe the benefits from being transparent and community-minded outweigh the down sides.  These benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Code.</strong>  Our clients get code that is built on an open framework which follows open and community-tested standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Painless Knowledge Transfer.</strong>  Transferring knowledge and code ownership back to our clients' own developers is much easier because most of the knowledge and Framework code is already publicly accessible via a set of hyperlinks.  Their developers can get straight to work without having to replicate a state of the art development team infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>No Vendor Lock-in.</strong>  We believe clients are less likely to leave us when they know that we make it easy for them to do so.  And when it's time to leave, we want them to continue to be as successful as possible.  Their success reflects positively on us.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer On-boarding.</strong>  Being open requires us to produce Framework code, Tutorials, and Knowledge Base entries that can withstand scrutiny from people who are not on our payroll.  That translates into better quality documentation and training materials, which makes it easier and faster for new developers to become productive and billable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

            <h3>Why Java?</h3>
            <p>We generally work with clients who need solutions that scale, in terms of both technology and team size.  And for scalable software engineering, we believe there is no better platform out there than enterprise Java.  Here are some of the reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track Record.</strong>  Java has been the number one programming language in the enterprise for nearly 20 years.  The only other technology that comes close is from Microsoft, which is a closed and proprietary platform controlled by one single company.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise Tools.</strong>  Over the years, many large companies such as IBM and Oracle (before and after buying Sun) have invested heavily in technology and tools that have benefited the entire Java community.  As a result, Java has the largest and most advanced set of tools available for performance tuning, profiling, debugging, load testing, continuous integration, and a wide range of other uses.</li>
            </ul>
